Slug: meetings

Meetings are free for everyone to participate in and are very informal. There are no membership fees but we do ask that you donate to help with some of the costs. Most meetings are just gatherings but sometimes we will have a presentation followed by a Q&A session. Presentations range from beginners level to technical.

SLUG meetings lately have been held at the Oak View Branch of the Siouxland Libraries in Sioux Falls.

Presentations generally start at 6:30pm on the third Thursday of each month. There is a new user session that starts earlier at 5:30pm.

Stay tuned to the mailing list for exact details.
