Meetings are free for everyone to participate in and are very informal. Most meetings are just gatherings but sometimes we will have a presentation followed by a Q&A session. Presentations range from beginners level to technical.

SLUG meetings lately have been held at the [Oak View Branch of the Siouxland Libraries in Sioux Falls](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=Oakview+Library,+3700+E+3rd+St,+Sioux+Falls,+SD+57103-6661&iwloc=A).

Presentations generally start at 6:30pm on the third Thursday of each month. There is a new user session that starts earlier at 5:30pm.

Stay tuned to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sluglinux) and [IRC channel]({filename}/pages/irc.md) for exact details.
