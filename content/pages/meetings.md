Meetings are free for everyone to participate in and are very informal.  Most meetings are just gatherings but sometimes we will have a presentation followed by a Q&A session.  Presentations range from beginners level to technical.

SLUG meetings lately have been held at the [Main Branch of the Siouxland Libraries in Downtown Sioux Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+N+Dakota+Ave,+Sioux+Falls,+SD+57104/@43.5492104,-96.7311125,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x878eb598bbcea107:0x8588b213cad08e56!8m2!3d43.5492104!4d-96.7289238).

Meetings generally start at 6:00pm on the third Wednesday of each month.

Stay tuned to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sluglinux) and [IRC channel]({filename}/pages/irc.md) for exact details.
